## Awana Bucks Earning System
- **Present at club:** 1 Awana buck
- **Has uniform:** 1 Awana buck
- **Brought Bible and handbook:** 1 Awana buck
- **Student completes section verse:** 1 Awana buck
- **Parent memorizes section verse:** 2 Awana bucks (student receives)
- **Completes silver section:** 1 Awana buck
- **Completes gold section:** 3 Awana bucks

## Key Helper Methods Needed
- `Student.calculateTotalBucks()` - Sum all bucksEarned from attendance and completions
- `Attendance.calculateBucksEarned()` - Auto-calculate based on present/uniform/bible/handbook
- `SectionVerseCompletion.calculateBucksEarned()` - Auto-calculate based on completion types
- `Household.getAllStudents()` - Get all students for QR code check-in
- `Calendar.getCurrentSemesterDates()` - Get active Awana schedule

## Business Logic Flow
1. **Check-In:** Scan household QR code → Display all students in household
2. **Attendance:** Mark present, uniform, Bible, handbook → Auto-calculate attendance bucks
3. **Club Time:** Leaders verify verse memorization, silver/gold completion → Record in SectionVerseCompletion
4. **Buck Calculation:** Real-time calculation of total bucks via helper methods
5. **Awana Store:** End-of-semester spending of accumulated bucks

## Frontend Implementation Plan

### Mobile-First Navigation System
- **Bottom Tab Bar:** Dashboard | Check-In | Students | Store | Reports
- **Context Cards:** Large touch-friendly action cards within each section
- **Touch-Optimized:** 44px minimum targets, thumb-friendly placement

### User Role-Based Dashboards
- **Commander/Director:** Club overview, all student stats, leader management
- **Section Leader:** My kids, verse progress, quick actions for my club
- **Store Manager:** Transaction queue, inventory, popular items

### Critical User Workflows (Priority Order)
1. **Family Check-In** - Scan QR → Display family → Toggle attendance → Calculate bucks
2. **Verse Completion** - Select student → Choose section → Mark completion → Award bucks
3. **Store Transaction** - Find student → Show balance → Select items → Complete purchase

### Touch-Optimized Components
- **Large Buttons:** 44px+ height, generous padding, clear active states
- **Mobile Forms:** Large inputs, touch-friendly controls
- **Visual Status:** Red/yellow/green indicators throughout
- **Celebration Animations:** For bucks earned, sections completed

### HTMX Integration Strategy
- **Dynamic View Rendering:** UniversalController renders view fragments based on context
- **Real-Time Updates:** Auto-refresh dashboard stats, instant feedback
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JS, enhanced with HTMX

### Implementation Approach
- **One feature at a time:** Implement, test, refine before moving to next
- **Start with Check-In:** Most critical workflow for club nights
- **Mobile-first design:** Touch-optimized for tablets and phones
- **Component library:** Reusable touch-friendly UI components

## Development Workflow
- **Iterative approach:** Implement one feature → test → refine → check off → next feature
- **User testing:** Test each implementation before moving forward
- **Touch device testing:** Validate on actual iPads/Android tablets used in clubs

## Universal Architecture Pattern - "Two-Phase Loading"

This is our signature pattern for creating consistent, fast-loading pages with progressive enhancement. **Use this pattern for ALL new pages and features.**

### The Pattern Explained

Every page follows a two-phase loading approach:

#### Phase 1: Page Shell (Instant Loading)
```groovy
// Controller action returns empty model - just renders page skeleton
def pageName() {
    // This just renders the pageName.gsp page skeleton
    // The actual content is loaded via /renderView?viewType=pageName
    [:]
}
```

#### Phase 2: Dynamic Content (Progressive Loading)
```gsp
<!-- In pageName.gsp - declarative HTMX loads content -->
<div id="page-content" 
     hx-get="/renderView?viewType=pageName" 
     hx-trigger="load"
     hx-swap="innerHTML">
    <!-- Dynamic content loads here via HTMX -->
</div>
```

#### ViewRenderMap Entry (Backend Logic)
```groovy
// In UniversalController viewRenderMap
'pageName': { params ->
    def data = universalDataService.list(SomeDomain)
    return [
        template: 'pageName',  // Points to _pageName.gsp
        model: [data: data]
    ]
}
```

### Why This Pattern?

1. **Instant Page Load** - Static shell appears immediately
2. **Progressive Enhancement** - Data loads in background
3. **Consistent Architecture** - Same pattern everywhere
4. **Backend Agnostic** - Logic in closures, not controller actions
5. **HTMX Native** - Declarative, no JavaScript needed

### Implementation Examples

#### Example 1: Clubs Management (Complete Implementation)
```groovy
// Controller action
def clubs() { [:] }

// ViewRenderMap entry
'clubs': { params ->
    def clubs = universalDataService.list(Club)
    return [template: 'clubs', model: [clubs: clubs, clubCount: clubs.size()]]
}
```

```gsp
<!-- clubs.gsp - page skeleton -->
<div id="clubs-page-content" 
     hx-get="/renderView?viewType=clubs" 
     hx-trigger="load"
     hx-swap="innerHTML">
</div>

<!-- _clubs.gsp - dynamic content template -->
<g:each in="${clubs}" var="club">
    <!-- Club content here -->
</g:each>
```

#### Example 2: Chapter Sections (Refactored from Custom Endpoint)

**❌ OLD WAY (Anti-pattern):**
```javascript
// Custom endpoint + JavaScript
htmx.ajax('GET', '/chapterSections', {
    values: { 'chapterId': chapterId },
    target: '#sections-container'
});

// Custom controller action (33 lines of redundant code)
def chapterSections() { /* redundant logic */ }
```

**✅ NEW WAY (Universal Pattern):**
```html
<!-- Declarative HTMX -->
<select hx-get="/renderView?viewType=chapterSections"
        hx-trigger="change"
        hx-target="#sections-container"
        hx-include="[name='chapterId']">
</select>
```

```groovy
// ViewRenderMap entry (reuses existing template)
'chapterSections': { params ->
    Long chapterId = params.long('chapterId') 
    def chapter = universalDataService.getById(Chapter, chapterId)
    def sections = chapter?.chapterSections ?: []
    return [template: 'chapterSections', model: [sections: sections, chapter: chapter]]
}
```

### Migration Checklist

When refactoring existing code to this pattern:

1. **✅ Identify Custom Endpoints** - Look for controller actions like `chapterSections()`, `loadSomething()`
2. **✅ Create ViewRenderMap Entry** - Move logic to closure in viewRenderMap
3. **✅ Replace JavaScript with HTMX** - Use declarative `hx-get="/renderView?viewType=X"`
4. **✅ Remove Custom Action** - Delete redundant controller method
5. **✅ Test Template Reuse** - Ensure existing `_templateName.gsp` works with new pattern

### Benefits Achieved

- **50+ lines of JavaScript removed** from verse completion
- **33 lines of controller code removed** (chapterSections action)
- **Consistent architecture** across clubs, checkin, students, verse completion
- **Zero custom endpoints** - everything goes through /renderView
- **Declarative HTMX** - no manual htmx.ajax() calls needed
