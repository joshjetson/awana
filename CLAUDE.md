# Awana Club Management System

A Grails 6.2.3 PWA application for tracking Awana club members, attendance, and Awana bucks rewards system.

## About Awana
Awana is an international evangelical Christian nonprofit organization focused on child and youth discipleship. The name derives from "Approved Workmen Are Not Ashamed" (2 Timothy 2:15). This application manages club attendance, Bible verse memorization progress, and the Awana bucks reward system.

## Business Logic Flow
1. **Check-In:** Scan household QR code ‚Üí Display all students in household
2. **Attendance:** Mark present, uniform, Bible, handbook ‚Üí Auto-calculate attendance bucks
3. **Club Time:** Leaders verify verse memorization, silver/gold completion ‚Üí Record in SectionVerseCompletion
4. **Buck Calculation:** Real-time calculation of total bucks via helper methods
5. **Awana Store:** End-of-semester spending of accumulated bucks
